![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/%E2%9A%BD.jpg)

# Introdution
Football is known as ‚Äúthe beautiful game‚Äù because of its enduring appeal throughout history. Today, as technology permeates modern football, data analytics has become an integral part of the sport, offering invaluable support to players, coaches, and decision-makers. By leveraging data, tactics can be optimized, player performance assessed more objectively, and strategic or transfer decisions made with greater precision. Against this backdrop, this project harnesses longitudinal data from EA SPORTS FIFA (now EA SPORTS FC) to analyze the evolution of tactical trends, uncover the attributes that define an outstanding player and evaluate the accuracy of virtual market valuations. The findings aim to provide actionable insights for squad building and strategic development in contemporary football.

# üéØ Purpose
- To analyze the evolution of modern football using EA SPORTS FIFA in-game data and data from Transfermarkt, by exploring tactical trends, player development, and market valuation logic.
- Analyzing tactical changes in modern football based on FIFA dataset from version 15 to 23 (2015 - 2023), through changes in player stats according to role, position and technical requirements.

# üìà Outcome
A comprehensive analysis that uncovers modern tactical shifts, reveals factors behind great footballers, and highlights discrepancies between perceived and real-world player values. This can offer valuable insights for heah coach, managers and football analysts.

# üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure
- Part 1 - Tactical Shift Over Time
- Part 2 ‚Äì The Making of a Great Player
- Part 3 - Market Pulse: Underrated vs Overrated


# üß© Research questions
- Which position has evolved the most in modern football?
- What attributes of positions have changed significantly over the years?
- Is there a shift in the tactics and playing style of football teams over time?
- What main attributes make a great player?
- What core attributes make a great player?
- What factors greatly affect a player's value?
- Is a player overrated or underrated?

# üîé Expectation insights
- ‚úÖ Modern defenders need more versatile.
- ‚úÖ Midfielders are becoming more all-round.
- ‚úÖ Goalkeepers are probably the most changed position as they have to play with their feet more.
- ‚úÖ Stats such as volleys, long shots, crossing have decreased, while vision, passing, reactions have increased sharply.
- ‚úÖ Playing style has changed from simple - direct to controlled - well-coordinated.
- ‚úÖ Excellent players often stand out in stats such as ball control, reactions, composure.
- ‚úÖ Player value is strongly influenced by overall, age, reputation, skill moves and technical stats.
- ‚úÖ Players who are mispriced can be detected by comparing predicted value with actual value.

## üìù Description
- This dataset contains detailed information on 161,583 male players in FIFA 23, in the "Career Mode" game. The data includes personal information, skill attributes, financial valuation, playing position and many other characteristics related to in-game performance.
- Because the player attributes and stats in the dataset are based on detailed statistics from EA SPORTS based on real-life performance and take into account a wide range of real-life factors to determine player stats, this dataset is suitable for analytical purposes such as:
  - Player valuation
  - Classification by position, nationality, or skill
  - Tracking tactical trends
  - Detecting potential or underrated players

# üö´ Data Restrictions
The data used in this project comes from two main domains:
- **FIFA 23 (EA Sports)** ‚Äî representing in-game player attributes and estimated market value (value_eur).
- **Transfermarkt** ‚Äî providing real-world player valuations (market_value_in_eur) along with individual and club-related metadata.

However, there are some key limitations to note:
- While EA Sports **FIFA player data** incorporates real-world performance assessments and many off-field factors, it **lacks comprehensive statistics** such as appearances, goals, assists, expected goals (xG), clean sheets, etc. Therefore, this project focuses solely on in-game attributes to explore and infer connections to real-world football‚Äîwhile acknowledging that these game-based metrics are a simulation of the entire real-world football landscape.
- **Discrepancy in value definition:** value_eur from FIFA may not be representative of real-world market behavior. It reflects EA‚Äôs internal in-game valuation model, which may undervalue or overvalue players relative to actual transfer fees.
- **Temporal mismatch:** FIFA 23 versions are released annually in **September of the previous year**, which means they represent player data up to 09/2022, not the calendar year 2023. But to avoid complexity and within the scope of this project, we will assume that each fifa_version represents the corresponding year.
- **Join key matching challenges:** Due to inconsistencies in player naming conventions and lack of metadata (e.g., date of birth, nationality), not all players can be successfully matched between the FIFA and Transfermarkt datasets. Matching is done using a composite key (name, date of birth, nationality name) with a reasonable success rate (68,830/161,583).
- **Multiple valuations per year:** Some players have been valued multiple times by Transfermarkt in the same year. In such cases, we used the **mean market value** for that year to maintain consistency.

# üßπ Data Cleaning and Processing
## FIFA 23 complete player dataset
- Remove unnessary columns
- Check data consistency
- Convert data type
- Rename columns like Transfermarkt dataset to set join key
- Drop duplicates

## Football Data from Transfermarkt
- Convert data type
- Check 'position' columns consistency
- Rename columns like FIFA dataset to set join key
- Drop N/A values in 'position' columns (~0.6%)
- Drop duplicates
- In the project we need to analyze by position, but in FIFA data this column is not suitable for the current analysis needs, so we will process it to merge with data from Transfermarkt, the steps are as follows:
  - Normalize the 'name' column in both datasets
  - Create a standardized join key (include name, date_of_birth and nationality_name).
  - Drop duplicates join key and merge both datasets
  - Mapping Transfermarkt position into 4 main groups
- Because in football the sets of stats for the 4 main position groups are different (for example, a goalkeeper cannot have a high shooting stat like a striker or a striker cannot defend as well as a defender), so we will fill N/A numeric columns by median in each position group (GK, DF, MF, FW).
- We need the transfermarket value for part 3 so we will join 2 datasets in transfermarkt are tm_players_df and tm_player_valuations via player_id after that join again with ff23_df via join key and year (map by fifa version).  
- Drop N/A values and reset index
- Here is main dataset after cleaning:

```

- Here we don't need to fillna for the market_value_in_eur column because it is **the actual market value of Transfermarkt**, we need real data to evaluate underrated/overrated for part 3.
- 5% missing is **acceptable**, we can filter out these rows when doing the final evaluation after building the model.

## Distribution by FIFA Version (Year)
![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/NumofPlayersbyFFVersion.png)

The bar chart shows that the number of players with complete attribute data (i.e., no major missing values) is quite consistent across FIFA versions from 2015 to 2023, ranging from approximately **6,800 to over 8,000 players per year**. This indicates that the filtered dataset is **balanced and reliable**, with no specific year being over- or under-represented. Such consistency allows for trustworthy time-series analyses.

The bar chart shows the distribution of players by position group:
- **Defenders (DF)** are the most numerous, with over **22,000 players**, indicating a wide variety of defensive roles represented in the data.
- **Midfielders (MF)** and **Forwards (FW)** have a fairly balanced count (around **18,000‚Äì20,000**), offering enough representation for detailed role-based analysis.
- **Goalkeepers (GK)** have the smallest count (around **7,000**), which is expected given that teams typically have fewer goalkeepers.
‚û°Ô∏è Overall, the player distribution is **balanced and sufficient**, allowing for meaningful position-based comparisons in subsequent analyses. In addition, if we look more closely, in a relative way we can see that based on the number of players in each position, the most popular formation used is 4-3-3 (4 defenders - 3 midfielders - 3 forwards), quite interesting, right?

## Distribution of main attributes

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/m10attrs.jpg)

According to EA Sports' calculation that we see in the picture, overall is averaged by main attributes, and main attributes are averaged by detailed attributes, so we only need to EDA by main attributes, then analyze in more detail.

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/DistributionbyMainAttrs.png)

**Insights:**
- **Pace:** slight right-skewed distribution, with most players having pace between **60‚Äì80**, peaking around **75‚Äì80**. Very fast players (90+) are rare.
- **Shooting:** highly right-skewed, most players have average shooting in the **30‚Äì70** range. Exceptional shooters (80+) are relatively few.
- **Passing:** almost normal distribution centered around **55‚Äì65**, indicating a balanced spread. Top-tier passers (above 80) are rare.
- **Dribbling:** concentrated around **60‚Äì70** with slight variation on both ends, reflecting consistent dribbling ability across player groups.
- **Defending:** bimodal shape, one peak at **30‚Äì40** (attackers, midfielders) and another at **60‚Äì70** (defensive roles), reflecting a clear divide between attack and defense.
- **Physic:** widely distributed with most values in the **60‚Äì80** range, peaking at **75‚Äì80**, showing physicality is a generally well-represented attribute.

## Correlation matrix of Main Attributes

**Insights:**
**üîç Strong Correlations:**
- **Passing ‚Äì Dribbling:** 0.82 ‚Üí Players who are good passers often excel at dribbling. This makes sense for playmakers (CAM, CM).
- **Shooting ‚Äì Dribbling:** 0.72 ‚Üí Players who shoot well also tend to dribble well ‚Äî commonly seen in technical forwards (ST, CF, wingers like Messi, Neymar, Mbapp√©).
- **Shooting ‚Äì Passing:** 0.64 ‚Üí Players with good shooting ability often have decent passing skills ‚Äî typical for all-rounded attacking midfielders (Kevin De Bruyne).

**üìâ Strong Negative Correlations:**
- **Shooting ‚Äì Defending:** -0.50 ‚Üí Attacking players (good shooters) usually aren't strong defenders ‚Äî clearly reflecting the difference between strikers and defenders.
- **Dribbling ‚Äì Defending:** -0.24 ‚Üí Players good at dribbling tend to be weaker at defending ‚Äî common for offensive roles.

**üìå Other Notable Relationships:**
- **Pace ‚Äì Dribbling:** 0.51 ‚Üí Fast players often dribble well ‚Äî usually wide players and wingers.
- **Defending ‚Äì Physic:** 0.58 ‚Üí Defenders and defensive midfielders usually possess strong physical attributes (CB, CDM).
- **Pace ‚Äì Defending:** -0.24 ‚Üí Good defenders aren't necessarily fast (with exceptions like modern fullbacks: Walker, Hakimi, etc).

**üß† Insight Summary:** Players can generally be grouped into two major clusters:
- **Technical ‚Äì Attacking Group:** Dribbling, Passing, Shooting, Pace (strong positive correlation within).
- **Physical ‚Äì Defensive Group:** Defending, Physic (positive correlation within, negatively correlated with technical attributes).

This correlation heatmap is useful for clustering player roles or building classification models based on player positions.

## Mean of main attributes by year and position groups
![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/MeanofMainAttrsbyYear%26Pos.png)

**Insights:**
- **Pace:** The average speed of forwards (FW) and defenders (DF) remains relatively stable over the years, while midfielders (MF) have seen a slight decline.
- **Shooting:** Forwards consistently have the highest shooting statistics with a slight upward trend, midfielders also have a slight upward trend while defenders are almost unchanged
- **Passing:** Midfielders (MF) lead the way in passing and show a steady increase over time. Other positional groups also show slight improvements.
- **Dribbling:** Dribbling remains high and stable for both forwards and midfielders. However, defenders show noticeable improvement over time, reflecting the increasing importance of ball control.
- **Defending:** Defenders maintain high and consistent defensive stats. Midfielders show a gradual increase, showing more all-round responsibility. Forwards also improve slightly despite their low values.
- **Physic:** Midfielders show slight improvement, while defenders and forwards remain largely unchanged.

## Boxplot of main attributes by year to check outliers
![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/BoxplotMainAttrsbyyear.png)

**Insights:**
- **Stable distribution:** The Pace, Shooting, Passing, Dribbling, Defending and Physic indicators all have a fairly stable distribution across FIFA versions. The Median and IQR do not change significantly, indicating that the player rating structure is maintained consistently.
- **Outliers:** There are many outliers, mainly players with very low ratings. This reflects the diversity of player quality in the game.
- **Differences between indicators:** Pace, Dribbling and Physic tend to be higher than Passing, Shooting and Defending, which are often concentrated at the average/low level.

> The EDA results show that the data has a clear structure, is stable over time and has a clear stratification between indicators. We don't need to remove outliers because these are all important data points that support the subsequent analysis well.

# Part 1 - Tactical Shift Over Time

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/%E2%9A%BD%E2%9A%BD%E2%9A%BD.jpg)

## Which position has evolved the most in modern football?
![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/MainAttrsbyPosOvertime.png)

Analyzing the evolution of average player attributes by position across FIFA editions provides an interesting lens for observing how tactical trends in contemporary football can be modeled and emphasized in-game. The charts show:
- **Core roles remain but with adjustments:** While the core positions remain specialised (Defensive/Physical Defenders, Passing/Dribbling Midfielders, Speed/Shooting Forwards), the change in average attributes shows an adaptation to modern tactics.
- **Increased Defensive Ability of Midfielders:** The most notable is the significant increase in the average Defensive attribute of the Midfielder (MF) group across editions. This clearly reflects the tactical trends in contemporary football, where midfielders are increasingly asked to participate in defensive work, from pressing high, covering the defence to recovering the ball in the midfield. Tactical systems such as Gegenpressing or formations with a mobile, versatile central midfielder are becoming increasingly popular.
- **The enduring importance of pace:** The pace attribute is quite stable in defenders and forwards. This emphasizes that, despite the increasing complexity of tactics, pace remains an extremely important factor in modern football, necessary for quick transitions, individual breakthroughs, or pressing and covering. However, in midfielders, there is a slight decrease, indicating the role of keeping the rhythm, controlling or regulating the tempo of the match.
- **A slight trend towards more well-rounded players:** The slight increase in some non-positional attributes (e.g. Passing/Dribbling in DF, Shooting/Physic in MF) may imply that modern football requires players in all positions to have a more diverse skill base to contribute to multiple aspects of the game, in line with tactics that emphasize versatility and positional interchangeability.
- **Traditional Strengths Remain Priorities:** Despite a slight ‚Äòversatility‚Äô, the core attributes that characterize each position remain the ones with the highest and most consistent average scores. This suggests that regardless of tactical changes, having players who excel in the core skills appropriate to their position of expertise remains the key to success.

> **In summary, data from FIFA suggests that the most notable tactical change reflected is the increased role and defensive demands on midfielders, alongside the continued importance of pace and the (slight) demand for greater versatility from players in all positions.**

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/GkAttrsOvertime.png)

- Footwork stats such as short passing, long passing have increased slightly over the years, especially vision has increased significantly, reflecting the need for goalkeepers to participate more in situations of developing the ball from the back line, and can play the role of a sweeper goalkeeper.
- Traditional stats such as diving, reflexes, positioning... remain stable over the years.
> **Modern goalkeepers must be good at both technical skills and coordination, becoming the "first initiator of attack".**

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/DFAttrsOvertime.png)

**Modern defenders are significantly improving their ability to play with their feet:**
- Stats such as short passing, ball control, dribbling, long passing, vision have all increased steadily over the years.
- On the contrary, skills such as long shots and finishing have increased slowly, remained the same or decreased slightly, showing that the goal-scoring role of defenders has not changed much.
> **The trend of ball-playing defenders is becoming more and more obvious, they not only defend but also participate in build-up play, distributing the ball from the back line.**

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/MFAttrsOvertime.png)

**Midfielders continue to be at the heart of tactics with consistent and consistent improvements in both:**
- Tactical thinking: positioning, vision
- Ball control & passing skills: short passing, long passing, dribbling, ball control
- Defensive ability: standing tackle, sliding tackle, marking awareness ‚Äì increased sharply, especially in the period 2019‚Äì2023.
> **Shows the emergence of complete midfielders ‚Äì both offensive and defensive, and controlling the tempo of the match.**

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/FWAttrsOvertime.png)
**Forwards in this period also had changes in their playing style:**
- Slight increase in short passing and vision skills, showing the role of supporting attack coordination and connecting with the lines is increasingly clear.
- Defensive indicators increased steadily and continuously from 2016 - 2023 (standing tackle, sliding tackle), especially marking awareness increased sharply from 2018 - 2019, reflecting the trend of strikers having to actively participate in high pressing/defending from a distance.
> **Forwards in modern football are no longer "poachers" who just wait for the ball but are also the first link in the defensive system.**
> 
**Conclusion**
> **In modern football, all positions have undergone significant evolution to adapt to increasingly complex tactical requirements and a higher pace of play. However, in terms of the ability to change and expand roles beyond traditional definitions, it can be said that the Goalkeeper (GK) and Defender (especially the full-back) are the two positions with the most obvious and revolutionary "evolution".**

## **What attributes of positions have changed significantly over the years?**
![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/MeanYearlyChangeinMainAttrs.png)

- Dribbling and Defending are the two most changed attributes
 - Defender (DF): Dribbling has increased the most, followed by Passing
‚û§ Defenders today need individual technique and the ability to deploy the ball from the back, not just pure defense.
 - Midfielder (MF): Defending has increased very strongly, surpassing Shooting and Dribbling
‚û§ Reflecting the trend of comprehensive midfielders: both organizing the play and participating in pressing, intercepting, and supporting defenders.
 - Forward (FW): Increasing steadily in many attributes, but Passing and Defending are notable
‚û§ Modern strikers not only know how to score goals but also participate in supporting pressing, building play, they are the first line of defense when the home team does not have the ball.

- Pace (speed) decreased significantly in midfielders, increased at least in the other 2 groups
‚û§ Shows that speed is no longer the decisive factor ‚Äî instead, tactical thinking, coordination and movement without the ball are.

**üìå Conclusion**
- The most significant changes over the years are Dribbling (especially in defenders), Defending (clearly in midfielders), and Passing (in defenders and forwards).
- The general trend is that modern players need to be more versatile, supporting the overall play instead of just doing well in individual roles.
- Speed ‚Äã‚Äã(Pace) is no longer a priority as before.

## **Is there a shift in the tactics and playing style of football teams over time?**

> ***Here we do not analyze the tactics of a specific team because the tactics of each team or a specific group of teams are different and there are many teams, we only rely on the changes in the core attributes of the players to see the overall picture of the typical playing styles of the teams.***

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/Top10Acs%26DescinCoreAttrsOvertime.png)

From this chart we can see that there has been a clear shift in the tactical meta of football during this period:
- **Volleys** have dropped the most, showing that **live shots that score goals are no longer popular** and that there are no players with good volleying ability during this period.
- **Long shots** have dropped the second most, showing that teams are **no longer relying on long-range shots** to score goals, but are shifting to **more methodical and calculated combinations.**
- **Crossing and heading accuracy are both in the top 10 of the biggest declines**, showing that teams are **no longer favoring the Anglo-Saxon style of overlapping, cross-heading or corner kicks** to score goals, which often relies heavily on **high-ball situations**.
- The indicators such as **vision, long passing, short passing, reactions and marking awareness** are all in the top 10 with the strongest increase, which reflects the **synchronous pressing and escaping pressing style from many lines that requires the ability to control, pass the ball, catch people and react quickly**, a hallmark of in modern football.
- The **goalkeeper's index** sets have also increased significantly over the years, showing that **goalkeepers must be more and more comprehensive and excellent** because in modern football, a save is no different from a goal, especially in big matches.

**Conclusion**
> **Football has always been in constant motion and change throughout its history, with increasingly high and complex tactical requirements, players also need to change to adapt, they are no longer constrained in traditional roles but are increasingly flexible and versatile.**

# **Part 2 ‚Äì The Making of a Great Player**

## **What main attributes make a great player?**
> ***Analysis is based on player attributes in EA FIFA game data, which reflect a gamified interpretation of real-life performance.***

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/MainAttrsbyPos(5%25vsOthrs).png)

- **Goalkeepers (GK):** Top 5% excel in **Diving, Handling, Positioning, Reflexes, Reactions.**
> A top goalkeeper cannot lack any GK skills ‚Äì from reflexes, positioning to ball handling. **Reactions** play a key role in dealing with dangerous situations.
- **Defenders (DF):** Top 5% have superior **Defending**, along with significantly higher **Passing, Dribbling, Shooting.**
> Modern defenders must not only defend well but also **handle the ball, pass the ball and support the attack.** Pace does not need to be too high if they can read the situation well.
- **Midfielders (MF):** The biggest difference lies in **Passing, Dribbling**, followed by Shooting.
> A great midfielder is someone who **holds the ball well, passes creatively and has the ability to finish the situation.** They dictate play and create chances for their teammates and themselves.
- **Forwards (FW):**
> Top 10% excel in **Shooting, Dribbling, Passing** ‚Äì the ultimate attacking skill set.
> Legendary forwards are those who **can decide the game with their individual skill** and scoring ability.

Now let's look at the boxplot representation of the distribution to see it more clearly.

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/GkAttrsDistribution(5%25vsOthrs).png)

- In the **goalkeeper (GK)** group, the players in the **top 5%** have a **well-rounded and consistent skill set.** They are not just excellent in a few stats, but are **equally good in all the mandatory aspects** of the GK position ‚Äì from **reflexes, positioning, kicking** to **reactions.**
- The Top 5% group has a shorter box, meaning low variability and few outliers, for example goalkeeping_reflexes and movement_reactions of the Top 5% group are both concentrated around 80‚Äì88. This implies that **Legend GKs are consistent**, maintaining a **high level of performance regardless of temporary fluctuations** in form.
- Notably, **reactions** and **reflexes** are the attributes that show the biggest gap between the Legend group and the rest ‚Äì this is related to the ability to **make spectacular saves**, which is **what makes a great goalkeeper.**

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/MainAttrsDistribution(5%25vsOthrs).png)

- **Overall:**
  - Across all metrics and roles, the **Top 5% are clearly superior** to the rest.
  - Not only do they have higher median values, but the **Top 5% are also more consistent** (shorter boxes, fewer outliers), showing that they are well-rounded and consistent players.
- **Defenders (DF):**
  - **Defending** is the most prominent strength, with the Top 5% having a median >80 compared to the rest of the group around ~65.
  - **Dribbling, Passing and Physic** also stand out, showing that today's top defenders are not only defensive but also participate in building play and competing strongly.
  - There is also a difference in **Pace** - speed is the factor that distinguishes normal defenders from top defenders.
>‚úÖ *A Great Defender is not only good at defending but also has good speed, stamina and ball handling technique.*
- **Midfielders (MF):**
  - **Passing and Dribbling** are the two most distinguishing factors ‚Äì Top 5% have excellent passing and dribbling abilities (~80 and above).
  - **Shooting, Defending and Physic** are also slightly better, showing that they are not only playmakers but can also defend or score directly when needed.
  - The difference in **pace** is less, a good midfielder does not need to be too fast.
> ‚úÖ *A Great Midfielder is a versatile player, capable of controlling the game with technique and physicality, while contributing to both attack and defense.*
- **Forwards (FW):**
  - **Shooting** is the most distinguishing factor ‚Äì Top 5% have median >80, while the other group ~65.
  - **Dribbling and Passing** are also clearly superior, showing that ball handling and passing skills are core factors.
  - **Pace and Physic** are also better ‚Äì a great forward is not only a goal scorer but also has good physicality and speed.
> ‚úÖ *A Great Forward is a player with excellent scoring ability, good dribbling and coordination, and has the speed to break through to create breakthroughs.*

**Conclusion**
> *In every position, the Top 5% players not only excel in a specific stat, but also have a **comprehensive and consistent performance**. The biggest difference between them and the rest lies in the core skills of each position ‚Äì for example: Reflexes & Reactions for Goalkeepers, Passing & Dribbling for Midfielders or Shooting & Dribbing for Forwards. It is this **consistent excellence** that is the foundation for creating a great player in football.*

## **What core attributes make a great player?**
> ***Based on FIFA player attributes, what are the core features that distinguish top 5% players from the rest?***
> 
- To analyze this we will use a logistic regression model to distinguish the great players (top 5%) from the rest.
- After determining the core attributes, we will train the model and evaluate it based on the classification report and the ROC Curve graph.

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/ClassRp.jpg)
![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/ROCCurve-LR.png)

Based on classification report and ROC Curve:
- Overall performance is very good: **Accuracy 97%**, **ROC AUC 0.99** ‚Üí the model distinguishes very well between top 5% players and the rest.
- The model achieves: **Precision = 0.82** and **Recall = 0.71** for class 1 (top 5% excellent players), meaning the model correctly detects many "great" players, **limiting false positives relatively well.**
- Note the imbalance of the data set: Class 1 only accounts for **about 6%** of the data set, this explains why Recall class 1 = 0.71, lower than class 0. However, **high precision** for class 1 is a positive point.

> ‚úÖ Logistic Regression Model Easy to understand, simple, shows very good efficiency in classifying "great players". Used to **determine the core attributes that make a great player** (via coefficients).

Next, we will analyze features importance via model and see which 15 features have the most impact.

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/LRCoffs-Top15Attrs.png)

"What core attributes make a great player?"
The most important attributes (by coefficient):
- **Reactions (‚Üë)** - Highest coefficient:
 - **The ability to react to second-ball situations in the match** is the most important factor that helps distinguish the top 5% players.
 - "Great" players often react quickly to situations, making the difference in important moments.
- **Positioning (‚Üì)** - Highest negative coefficient. Although it seems paradoxical, the negative coefficient here **does not mean that this index is bad**, but it can be due to:
 - This index is often high in forwards, not common in midfielders or defenders
 - Or because this variable is negatively correlated with being in the top 5% because the model differentiates by position.
- **Ball control (‚Üë)** and **short passing (‚Üë)**
‚Üí Technical ball handling, control and short passing skills are important for top players.
- **Reflexes (‚Üë)** and other GK stats ‚Üí Suggests that the top 5% also **include excellent goalkeepers**, who are considered half of the team.
- **Sprint speed (‚Üë)** and **heading accuracy (‚Üë)** ‚Üí Sprint speed and heading ability ‚Äì typical skills of high-class forwards.

> üìå The best players usually possess:
- **Quick reactions**
- **Good ball control and short passing**
- **High speed**
- **Role-specific skills ‚Äì such as reflexes (GK), short passing (MF) or heading accuracy (FW)**

**Conclusion**
> ***Apart from the goalkeeper position, which is a very special position in football, we can see that the most core attributes of a great player are all in the stats that serve the ability to attack and find goals. This means that a midfielder or forward who plays well will always have an advantage over a defender in the race for individual titles, which is absolutely true in modern football.***

# **Part 3 - Market Pulse: Underrated vs Overrated**

## **What factors greatly affect a player's value?**
- To analyze this, we will use one-hot encoding for non-numeric columns such as work_rate, player_tags, player_traits, preferred_foot, position_group.

With specific player dataset like FIFA's which has many attributes and is often non-linear, we will use Random Forest Regression to predict player value because this model is less sensitive to outliers. However, we will build 2 parallel models Linear Regression and Random Forest to compare why Random Forest is chosen.

|0|Linear Regression|2469849|4954150|0\.662|
|1|Random Forest|811567|2351944|0\.9238|

After train 2 models and evaluate them we can see the comparison between **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest** clearly demonstrates the superiority of Random Forest:
- The **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** of Random Forest is only around **803k**, while Linear Regression is nearly **three times higher (~2.1 million)** ‚Üí indicating that Random Forest predicts much closer to actual values.
- The **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** of Random Forest is **also almost half** that of Linear Regression **(2.3 million vs 4.6 million)** ‚Üí confirming its ability to reduce large errors.
- The **R¬≤ Score** of Random Forest reaches **0.9253**, showing that the model explains **92.53% of the variance** in the data, much higher than Linear Regression (**70.9%**).

> üëâ Random Forest outperforms Linear Regression across all three metrics and is especially suitable for predicting player values in a complex, non-linear dataset like FIFA.

Next, we will evaluate 2 models based on error distribution:

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/CompareLR%26RF.png)

**Linear Regression:**
- The error distribution is **wide and asymmetric**, with a noticeable right skew (indicating underestimation).
- Some **large outliers on the positive side** ‚Üí the model significantly **underpredicts the value of expensive players.**
- The **long right tail** shows poor accuracy for high-value players.

**Random Forest:**
- The error distribution is **more concentrated around 0** and **nearly symmetrical.**
- The **sharp, narrow peak** indicates that most predictions are close to the actual values.
- **Fewer outliers** ‚Üí the model is more **stable and reliable**, regardless of player value.

‚úÖ **Conclusion:**
- **Random Forest clearly outperforms Linear Regression** in terms of both accuracy and stability.
- While Linear Regression is sensitive to outliers (especially high-value players), **Random Forest handles non-linear patterns more effectively.**
- This demonstrates that **Linear Regression is not suitable for player value prediction**, whereas **Random Forest is a more reliable model for predicting** value_eur.

And now we can analyze features importance based on Random Forest model:

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/Top20Factors(RF).png)

**Factor Importance Analysis (Top 20 Factors):**

The chart illustrates the impact of input features on player value, as evaluated by the Random Forest model. The results reveal several key insights:
- **Potential** is the most influential feature, accounting for over 50% of the total importance. This highlights the crucial role of future development in determining a player's market value, especially for younger talents.
- **Movement Reactions** ranks second, indicating how quickly a player responds to in-game situations. This metric encapsulates real-time performance and is often associated with players who are consistent and impactful during matches.
- **Wage (EUR)**, a clear financial indicator, reflects the relationship between a player's salary and market value. Players with higher wages often hold key roles within the squad and command higher transfer values.
- Features related to **mentality and age** also demonstrate notable influence:
 - Variables such as **Mentality Composure** (calmness) and **Age** capture maturity and professional experience ‚Äî both of which contribute to a player‚Äôs overall stability and market perception.
 - In contrast, **technical skills** such as ball control, sprint speed, and dribbling, while still relevant, carry lower importance weights compared to long-term strategic indicators.

**Overall Insight**
> **Strategic and long-term factors (e.g., potential, reactions, wage, age) outweigh pure technical abilities** in determining player value. This reflects a broader market perspective that emphasizes future value and consistency over short-term technical performance.

**Conclusion**
**A player's market value is not solely based on current skill levels but is significantly shaped by their growth potential, tactical responsiveness, wage level, and accumulated experience. This suggests that clubs and transfer markets assess players holistically, giving priority to attributes that reflect long-term investment and strategic value.**

## **Is a player overrated or underrated?**

Before analyzing this we will evaluate a little more about RF model:

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/EvaluateRF.png)

- The points distributed close to the diagonal indicate that the Random Forest model learns the relationship between the features and the player value quite effectively.
- Compared to Linear Regression ‚Äì which produces larger systematic errors and is difficult to capture nonlinear relationships ‚Äì RF shows **better generalization ability.**
- Although there is still an **underestimation** phenomenon with extremely high-value players (due to lack of data or special factors), the results are generally **stable and reliable**.

Now we can show the TOP 10 Overrated Players:

**Analysis of Overrated & Underrated Players**

The chart highlights top 10 players whose market values are either significantly higher (overrated) or lower (underrated) than their predicted values based on a Random Forest valuation model.

**Key Insights:**

**üü• Underrated Players ‚Äì Smart Transfer Opportunities**

Underrated players have predicted values that are significantly higher than their current market prices. This presents an excellent opportunity for clubs to acquire talents **at a lower cost than their true worth**, making it especially valuable for clubs with limited budgets or long-term investment strategies.
Such players often share one or more of the following characteristics:
- **High development potential** that has not yet been fully realized.
- **Outstanding performance** that exceeds expectations but has not garnered media attention.
- Playing for **smaller clubs**, which may lead to underappreciation in the market.
> **Practical Application:** Clubs can use this insight to identify **hidden gems**, secure undervalued signings, and optimize transfer spending ‚Äî gaining both **competitive edge on the pitch** and **financial efficiency** off it.

**üü© Overrated Players ‚Äì Investment Risks**

In contrast, overrated players have market values that **exceed their predicted worth**, suggesting they may be **overhyped by media, inconsistent in performance, pursued by multiple clubs, or paid excessively relative to their actual impact.**
> **Practical Application:** Early identification of overrated players allows clubs to **avoid risky or overpriced transfers, negotiate more realistic transfer fees** for targets, and **reevaluate salary structures** or **transfer decisions** based on true value rather than perception.

**Conclusion:**
The Overrated ‚Äì Underrated analysis is not just a data exercise ‚Äî it's a **strategic tool** in scouting, recruitment, and transfer planning. By leveraging data-driven valuation models, clubs can:
- Identify **high-potential transfer targets** at fair or bargain prices.
- Minimize **financial risks** associated with overpaying.
- Optimize **human resource investment** based on objective performance indicators rather than subjective bias or media influence.

**üìå Recommendations for Clubs & Transfer Analysts:**
- **Integrate Predictive Valuation into Scouting Pipelines**
Use machine learning-based valuation as a standard filter when evaluating new player targets. This enables **early identification of undervalued talent and helps prioritize recruitment efforts.**
- **Build a "Watchlist" of Underrated Players**
Maintain a dynamic list of players flagged by the model as underrated. These could be **ideal transfer targets** for clubs with long-term planning, youth development focus, or financial limitations.
- **Avoid Overpaying Through Objective Benchmarks**
Before finalizing high-profile signings, use predicted valuations to **benchmark against hype-driven market prices**, minimizing the risk of signing **overpriced or underperforming players.**
- **Strengthen Negotiation Leverage**
Data-backed insights on overvaluation can be a **powerful negotiation tool**, helping clubs argue for lower transfer fees or structured payment plans based on actual performance.
- **Combine Model Output with Human Expertise**
While predictive models offer quantitative power, they should **complement, not replace**, the work of scouts and analysts. A hybrid approach‚Äîbalancing data with tactical fit, attitude, and injury history‚Äîyields the best decisions.
> ‚öΩ **Final Thought:**
In an era where **transfer decisions can define a club's future**, embracing data-driven valuation isn't just a competitive advantage ‚Äî it's a **necessity for modern football success.**
