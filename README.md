![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/%E2%9A%BD.jpg)

# Introdution
Football is known as ‚Äúthe king game‚Äù because of its enduring appeal throughout history. Today, as technology permeates modern football, data analytics has become an integral part of the sport, offering invaluable support to players, coaches, and decision-makers. By leveraging data, tactics can be optimized, player performance assessed more objectively, and strategic or transfer decisions made with greater precision. Against this backdrop, this project harnesses longitudinal data from EA SPORTS FIFA (now EA SPORTS FC) to analyze the evolution of tactical trends, uncover the attributes that define outstanding players and estimate the value of a player in reality. The findings aim to provide actionable insights for squad building and strategic development in contemporary football.

# üéØ Purpose
- To analyze the evolution of modern football using EA SPORTS FIFA in-game data and data from Transfermarkt, by exploring tactical trends, player development, and market valuation logic.
- Analyzing tactical changes in modern football based on FIFA dataset from version 15 to 23 (2015 - 2023), through changes in player stats according to role, position and technical requirements.

# üìà Outcome
A comprehensive analysis that uncovers modern tactical shifts, reveals factors behind great footballers, and highlights discrepancies between perceived and real-world player values. This can offer valuable insights for head coach, scouts and football analysts.

# üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure
- Part 1 - Tactical Shift Over Time
- Part 2 ‚Äì The Making of a Great Player
- Part 3 - Market Pulse: Estimating Real-Life Player Value


# üß© Research questions
- Which position has evolved the most in modern football?
- What attributes of positions have changed significantly over the years?
- Is there a shift in the tactics and playing style of football teams over time?
- What main attributes make great players?
- What core attributes make great players?
- What factors greatly affect a player's value?
- Can we use in-game attributes to approximate real-world player value?

# üîé Expectation insights
- ‚úÖ Modern defenders need more versatile.
- ‚úÖ Midfielders are becoming more all-round.
- ‚úÖ Goalkeepers are probably the most changed position as they have to play with their feet more.
- ‚úÖ Stats such as volleys, long shots, crossing have decreased, while vision, passing, reactions have increased sharply.
- ‚úÖ Playing style has changed from simple - direct to controlled - well-coordinated.
- ‚úÖ Excellent players often stand out in stats such as ball control, reactions, composure.
- ‚úÖ Player value is strongly influenced by overall, age, reputation, skill moves and technical stats.
- ‚úÖ Players who are mispriced can be detected by comparing predicted value with actual value.

## üìù Description
- This dataset contains detailed information on 161,583 male players in FIFA 23, in the "Career Mode" game. The data includes personal information, skill attributes, financial valuation, playing position and many other characteristics related to in-game performance.
- Because the player attributes and stats in the dataset are based on detailed statistics from EA SPORTS based on real-life performance and take into account a wide range of real-life factors to determine player stats, this dataset is suitable for analytical purposes such as:
  - Player valuation
  - Classification by position, nationality, or skill
  - Tracking tactical trends
  - Detecting potential or underrated players

# üö´ Data Restrictions
The data used in this project comes from two main domains:
- **FIFA 23 (EA Sports)** ‚Äî representing in-game player attributes and estimated market value (value_eur).
- **Transfermarkt** ‚Äî providing real-world player valuations (market_value_in_eur) along with individual and club-related metadata.

However, there are some key limitations to note:
- While EA Sports **FIFA player data** incorporates real-world performance assessments and many off-field factors, it **lacks of comprehensive statistics** such as appearances, goals, assists, expected goals (xG), clean sheets, etc. Therefore, this project focuses solely on in-game attributes to explore and infer connections to real-world football‚Äîwhile acknowledging that these game-based metrics are a simulation of the entire real-world football landscape.
- In football there are many specialized positions according to roles (more than 10) and in fact a player can play many positions on the field, but in **FIFA data there is no division by main position and alternative position** so we have to combine data from Transfermarkt to get information about the role that the player is usually known for, and analyze according to 4 main position groups (goalkeeper, defender, midfielder and forward).
- **Discrepancy in value definition:** value_eur from FIFA may not be representative of real-world market behavior. It reflects EA‚Äôs internal in-game valuation model, which may undervalue or overvalue players relative to actual transfer fees.
- **Temporal mismatch:** FIFA 23 versions are released annually in **September of the previous year**, which means they represent player data up to 09/2022, not the calendar year 2023. But to avoid complexity and within the scope of this project, we will assume that each fifa_version represents the corresponding year.
- **Join key matching challenges:** Due to inconsistencies in player naming conventions and lack of metadata (e.g., date of birth, nationality), not all players can be successfully matched between the FIFA and Transfermarkt datasets. Matching is done using a composite key (name, date of birth, nationality name) with a reasonable success rate (68,830/161,583).
- **Multiple valuations per year:** Some players have been valued multiple times by Transfermarkt in the same year. In such cases, we used the **mean market value** for that year to maintain consistency.

# üßπ Data Cleaning and Processing
## FIFA 23 complete player dataset
- Remove unnessary columns
- Check data consistency
- Convert data type
- Rename columns like Transfermarkt dataset to set join key
- Drop duplicates

## Football Data from Transfermarkt
- Convert data type
- Check 'position' columns consistency
- Rename columns like FIFA dataset to set join key
- Drop N/A values in 'position' columns (~0.6%)
- Drop duplicates
- In the project we need to analyze by position, but in FIFA data this column is not suitable for the current analysis needs, so we will process it to merge with data from Transfermarkt, the steps are as follows:
  - Normalize the 'name' column in both datasets
  - Create a standardized join key (include name, date_of_birth and nationality_name).
  - Drop duplicates join key and merge both datasets
  - Mapping Transfermarkt position into 4 main groups
- Because in football the sets of stats for the 4 main position groups are different (for example, a goalkeeper cannot have a high shooting stat like a striker or a striker cannot defend as well as a defender), so we will fill N/A numeric columns by median in each position group (GK, DF, MF, FW).
- We need the transfermarket value for part 3 so we will join 2 datasets in transfermarkt are tm_players_df and tm_player_valuations via player_id after that join again with ff23_df via join key and year (map by fifa version).  
- Drop N/A values and reset index
- Here is main dataset after cleaning:

- Here we don't need to fillna for the market_value_in_eur column because it is **the actual market value of Transfermarkt**, we need real data to evaluate underrated/overrated for part 3.
- 5% missing is **acceptable**, we can drop these rows before performing model building and evaluate after model building.

## Distribution by FIFA Version (Year)

The bar chart shows that the number of players with complete attribute data (i.e., no major missing values) is quite consistent across FIFA versions from 2015 to 2023, ranging from approximately **6,800 to over 8,000 players per year**. This indicates that the filtered dataset is **balanced and reliable**, with no specific year being over- or under-represented. Such consistency allows for trustworthy time-series analyses.

## Distribution by position groups
![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/PlayerDistributionbyPositionGroup.png)

The bar chart shows the distribution of players by position group:
- **Defenders (DF)** are the most numerous, with over **22,000 players**, indicating a wide variety of defensive roles represented in the data.
- **Midfielders (MF)** and **Forwards (FW)** have a fairly balanced count (around **18,000‚Äì20,000**), offering enough representation for detailed role-based analysis.
- **Goalkeepers (GK)** have the smallest count (around **7,000**), which is expected given that teams typically have fewer goalkeepers.
‚û°Ô∏è Overall, the player distribution is **balanced and sufficient**, allowing for meaningful position-based comparisons in subsequent analyses. In addition, if we look more closely, in a relative way we can see that based on the number of players in each position, the most popular formation used is 4-3-3 (4 defenders - 3 midfielders - 3 forwards), quite interesting, right?

## Distribution of main attributes

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/m10attrs.jpg)

According to EA Sports' calculation that we see in the picture, overall is averaged by main attributes, and main attributes are averaged by detailed attributes, so we only need to EDA by main attributes, then analyze in more detail.

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/DistributionbyMainAttrs.png)

**Insights:**
- **Pace:** slight right-skewed distribution, with most players having pace between **60‚Äì80**, peaking around **75‚Äì80**. Very fast players (90+) are rare.
- **Shooting:** highly right-skewed, most players have average shooting in the **30‚Äì70** range. Exceptional shooters (80+) are relatively few.
- **Passing:** almost normal distribution centered around **55‚Äì65**, indicating a balanced spread. Top-tier passers (above 80) are rare.
- **Dribbling:** concentrated around **60‚Äì70** with slight variation on both ends, reflecting consistent dribbling ability across player groups.
- **Defending:** bimodal shape, one peak at **30‚Äì40** (attackers, midfielders) and another at **60‚Äì70** (defensive roles), reflecting a clear divide between attack and defense.
- **Physic:** widely distributed with most values in the **60‚Äì80** range, peaking at **75‚Äì80**, showing physicality is a generally well-represented attribute.

## Correlation matrix of Main Attributes
![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/CorrMatrxofMainAttrs.png)

**Insights:**
**üîç Strong Correlations:**
- **Passing ‚Äì Dribbling:** 0.82 ‚Üí Players who are good passers often excel at dribbling. This makes sense for playmakers (CAM, CM).
- **Shooting ‚Äì Dribbling:** 0.72 ‚Üí Players who shoot well also tend to dribble well ‚Äî commonly seen in technical forwards (ST, CF, wingers like Messi, Neymar, Mbapp√©).
- **Shooting ‚Äì Passing:** 0.64 ‚Üí Players with good shooting ability often have decent passing skills ‚Äî typical for all-rounded attacking midfielders (Kevin De Bruyne).

**üìâ Strong Negative Correlations:**
- **Shooting ‚Äì Defending:** -0.50 ‚Üí Attacking players (good shooters) usually aren't strong defenders ‚Äî clearly reflecting the difference between strikers and defenders.
- **Dribbling ‚Äì Defending:** -0.24 ‚Üí Players good at dribbling tend to be weaker at defending ‚Äî common for offensive roles.

**üìå Other Notable Relationships:**
- **Pace ‚Äì Dribbling:** 0.51 ‚Üí Fast players often dribble well ‚Äî usually wide players and wingers.
- **Defending ‚Äì Physic:** 0.58 ‚Üí Defenders and defensive midfielders usually possess strong physical attributes (CB, CDM).
- **Pace ‚Äì Defending:** -0.24 ‚Üí Good defenders aren't necessarily fast (with exceptions like modern fullbacks: Walker, Hakimi, etc).

**üß† Insight Summary:** Players can generally be grouped into two major clusters:
- **Technical ‚Äì Attacking Group:** Dribbling, Passing, Shooting, Pace (strong positive correlation within).
- **Physical ‚Äì Defensive Group:** Defending, Physic (positive correlation within, negatively correlated with technical attributes).

This correlation heatmap is useful for clustering player roles or building classification models based on player positions.

- **Shooting:** Forwards consistently have the highest shooting statistics with a slight upward trend, midfielders also have a slight upward trend while defenders are almost unchanged
- **Passing:** Midfielders (MF) lead the way in passing and show a steady increase over time. Other positional groups also show slight improvements.
- **Dribbling:** Dribbling remains high and stable for both forwards and midfielders. However, defenders show noticeable improvement over time, reflecting the increasing importance of ball control.
- **Defending:** Defenders maintain high and consistent defensive stats. Midfielders show a gradual increase, showing more all-round responsibility. Forwards also improve slightly despite their low values.
- **Physic:** Midfielders show slight improvement, while defenders and forwards remain largely unchanged.

## Boxplot of main attributes by year to check outliers
![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/BoxplotMainAttrsbyyear.png)

**Insights:**
- **Stable distribution:** The Pace, Shooting, Passing, Dribbling, Defending and Physic indicators all have a fairly stable distribution across FIFA versions. The Median and IQR do not change significantly, indicating that the player rating structure is maintained consistently.
- **Outliers:** There are many outliers, mainly players with very low ratings. This reflects the diversity of player quality in the game.
- **Differences between indicators:** Pace, Dribbling and Physic tend to be higher than Passing, Shooting and Defending, which are often concentrated at the average/low level.

> The EDA results show that the data has a clear structure, is stable over time and has a clear stratification between indicators. We don't need to remove outliers because these are all important data points that support the subsequent analysis well.

# Part 1 - Tactical Shift Over Time

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/%E2%9A%BD%E2%9A%BD.jpg)

## Which position has evolved the most in modern football?
![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/MainAttrsbyPosOvertime.png)

Analyzing the evolution of average player attributes by position across FIFA editions provides an interesting lens for observing how tactical trends in contemporary football can be modeled and emphasized in-game. The charts show:
- **Core roles remain but with adjustments:** While the core positions remain specialised (Defensive/Physical Defenders, Passing/Dribbling Midfielders, Speed/Shooting Forwards), the change in average attributes shows an adaptation to modern tactics.
- **Increased Defensive Ability of Midfielders:** The most notable is the significant increase in the average Defensive attribute of the Midfielder (MF) group across editions. This clearly reflects the tactical trends in contemporary football, where midfielders are increasingly asked to participate in defensive work, from pressing high, covering the defence to recovering the ball in the midfield. Tactical systems such as Gegenpressing or formations with a mobile, versatile central midfielder are becoming increasingly popular.
- **The enduring importance of pace:** The pace attribute is quite stable in defenders and forwards. This emphasizes that, despite the increasing complexity of tactics, pace remains an extremely important factor in modern football, necessary for quick transitions, individual breakthroughs, or pressing and covering. However, in midfielders, there is a slight decrease, indicating the role of keeping the rhythm, controlling or regulating the tempo of the match.
- **A slight trend towards more well-rounded players:** The slight increase in some non-positional attributes (e.g. Passing/Dribbling in DF, Shooting/Physic in MF) may imply that modern football requires players in all positions to have a more diverse skill base to contribute to multiple aspects of the game, in line with tactics that emphasize versatility and positional interchangeability.
- **Traditional Strengths Remain Priorities:** Despite a slight ‚Äòversatility‚Äô, the core attributes that characterize each position remain the ones with the highest and most consistent average scores. This suggests that regardless of tactical changes, having players who excel in the core skills appropriate to their position of expertise remains the key to success.

> **In summary, data from FIFA suggests that the most notable tactical change reflected is the increased role and defensive demands on midfielders, alongside the continued importance of pace and the (slight) demand for greater versatility from players in all positions.**

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/GkAttrsOvertime.png)

- Footwork stats such as short passing, long passing have increased slightly over the years, especially vision has increased significantly, reflecting the need for goalkeepers to participate more in situations of developing the ball from the back line, and can play the role of a sweeper goalkeeper.
- Traditional stats such as diving, reflexes, positioning... remain stable over the years.
> **Modern goalkeepers must be good at both technical skills and coordination, becoming the "first initiator of attack".**

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/DFAttrsOvertime.png)

**Modern defenders are significantly improving their ability to play with their feet:**
- Stats such as short passing, ball control, dribbling, long passing, vision have all increased steadily over the years.
- On the contrary, skills such as long shots and finishing have increased slowly, remained the same or decreased slightly, showing that the goal-scoring role of defenders has not changed much.
> **The trend of ball-playing defenders is becoming more and more obvious, they not only defend but also participate in build-up play, distributing the ball from the back line.**

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/MFAttrsOvertime.png)

**Midfielders continue to be at the heart of tactics with consistent and consistent improvements in both:**
- Tactical thinking: positioning, vision
- Ball control & passing skills: short passing, long passing, dribbling, ball control
- Defensive ability: standing tackle, sliding tackle, marking awareness ‚Äì increased sharply, especially in the period 2019‚Äì2023.
> **Shows the emergence of complete midfielders ‚Äì both offensive and defensive, and controlling the tempo of the match.**

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/FWAttrsOvertime.png)

**Forwards in this period also had changes in their playing style:**
- Slight increase in short passing and vision skills, showing the role of supporting attack coordination and connecting with the lines is increasingly clear.
- Defensive indicators increased steadily and continuously from 2016 - 2023 (standing tackle, sliding tackle), especially marking awareness increased sharply from 2018 - 2019, reflecting the trend of strikers having to actively participate in high pressing/defending from a distance.
> **Forwards in modern football are no longer "poachers" who just wait for the ball but are also the first link in the defensive system.**
> 
**üìå Conclusion**
> **In modern football, all positions have undergone significant evolution to adapt to increasingly complex tactical requirements and a higher pace of play. However, in terms of the ability to change and expand roles beyond traditional definitions, it can be said that the Goalkeeper (GK) and Defender (especially the full-back) are the two positions with the most obvious and revolutionary "evolution".**

## **What attributes of positions have changed significantly over the years?**
![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/MeanYearlyChangeinMainAttrs.png)

- Dribbling and Defending are the two most changed attributes
  - Defender (DF): Dribbling has increased the most, followed by Passing ‚û§ Defenders today need individual technique and the ability to deploy the ball from the back, not just pure defense.
  - Midfielder (MF): Defending has increased very strongly, surpassing Shooting and Dribbling ‚û§ Reflecting the trend of comprehensive midfielders: both organizing the play and participating in pressing, intercepting, and supporting defenders.
  - Forward (FW): Increasing steadily in many attributes, but Passing and Defending are notable ‚û§ Modern strikers not only know how to score goals but also participate in supporting pressing, building play, they are the first line of defense when the home team does not have the ball.
- Pace (speed) decreased significantly in midfielders, increased at least in the other 2 groups ‚û§ Shows that speed is no longer the decisive factor ‚Äî instead, tactical thinking, coordination and movement without the ball are.

**üìå Conclusion**
- The most significant changes over the years are Dribbling (especially in defenders), Defending (clearly in midfielders), and Passing (in defenders and forwards).
- The general trend is that modern players need to be more versatile, supporting the overall play instead of just doing well in individual roles.
- Speed ‚Äã‚Äã(Pace) is no longer a priority as before.

## **Is there a shift in the tactics and playing style of football teams over time?**

> ***Here we do not analyze the tactics of a specific team because the tactics of each team or a specific group of teams are different and there are many teams, we only rely on the changes in the core attributes of the players to see the overall picture of the typical playing styles of the teams.***

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/Top10Acs%26DescinCoreAttrsOvertime.png)

From this chart we can see that there has been a clear shift in the tactical meta of football during this period:
- **Volleys** have dropped the most, showing that **live shots that score goals are no longer popular** and that there are no players with good volleying ability during this period.
- **Long shots** have dropped the second most, showing that teams are **no longer relying on long-range shots** to score goals, but are shifting to **more methodical and calculated combinations.**
- **Crossing and heading accuracy are both in the top 10 of the biggest declines**, showing that teams are **no longer favoring the Anglo-Saxon style of overlapping, cross-heading or corner kicks** to score goals, which often relies heavily on **high-ball situations**.
- The indicators such as **vision, long passing, short passing, reactions and marking awareness** are all in the top 10 with the strongest increase, which reflects the **synchronous pressing and escaping pressing style from many lines that requires the ability to control, pass the ball, catch people and react quickly**, a hallmark of in modern football.
- The **goalkeeper's index** sets have also increased significantly over the years, showing that **goalkeepers must be more and more comprehensive and excellent** because in modern football, a save is no different from a goal, especially in big matches.

**üìå Conclusion**
> **Football has always been in constant motion and change throughout its history, with increasingly high and complex tactical requirements, players also need to change to adapt, they are no longer constrained in traditional roles but are increasingly flexible and versatile.**

### **Recommendations for Coaches, Scouts, and Football Analysts**

**For Coaches**
- **Integrate versatility into training philosophy:** Encourage players, especially defenders and midfielders, to develop skills beyond their traditional roles. For example, defenders should be trained in ball control and distribution, while midfielders should be drilled on defensive positioning and recovery.
- **Tactical emphasis on collective pressing and transition play:** Build tactical systems that emphasize **press-resistance**, **quick transitions**, and **fluid positional play**, leveraging the modern player's broader skillset.
- **Adapt to player evolution:** Utilize players who can operate in multiple systems and positions (e.g., inverted full-backs, hybrid midfielders), maximizing tactical flexibility against different opponents.

**For Football Analysts**
- **Update performance benchmarks by position:** Attribute baselines need to be adjusted as traditional roles have evolved. For instance, a modern centre-back‚Äôs passing stats may now be as critical as their tackling.
- **Incorporate attribute evolution into player evaluations:** Use historical attribute trends to predict future value and role adaptability, especially for youth development and long-term squad planning.
- **Quantify versatility impact:** Measure how players with higher cross-positional attributes contribute to team success, particularly in systems reliant on **fluid formations** or **total football principles.**

**For Scouting & Recruitment**
- **Target multi-dimensional profiles:** Prioritize scouting players who show high development in **non-traditional attributes** for their position (e.g., high Dribbling/Passing for defenders or high Defending for forwards).
- **Track attribute trends to spot undervalued talent:** Use insights on emerging tactical requirements (e.g., pressing forwards or playmaking full-backs) to identify underrated players who may not stand out under older scouting criteria.
- **Scout for cognitive & tactical intelligence:** Prioritize players with high vision, reaction, and marking awareness ‚Äî key traits that support modern tactical systems like **gegenpressing, positional play**, and **build-up from the back.**

üèÅ **Summary**
> The tactical transformation of modern football demands **multifunctional, tactically intelligent players.** Coaches should train adaptability, scouts should find versatility, and analysts must redefine excellence based on evolving roles ‚Äî because success no longer lies in specialization alone, but in **synchronized versatility.**


# **Part 2 ‚Äì The Making of Great Players**
> ***This study focuses on in-game attributes only, not real-life performance metrics.***

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/Gullit.jpg)

## **What main attributes make great players?**
> ***Analysis is based on player attributes in EA FIFA game data, which reflect a gamified interpretation of real-life performance.***

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/MainAttrsbyPos(5%25vsOthrs).png)

- **Goalkeepers (GK):** Top 5% excel in **Diving, Handling, Positioning, Reflexes, Reactions.**
> A top goalkeeper cannot lack any GK skills ‚Äì from reflexes, positioning to ball handling. **Reactions** play a key role in dealing with dangerous situations.
- **Defenders (DF):** Top 5% have superior **Defending**, along with significantly higher **Passing, Dribbling, Shooting.**
> Modern defenders must not only defend well but also **handle the ball, pass the ball and support the attack.** Pace does not need to be too high if they can read the situation well.
- **Midfielders (MF):** The biggest difference lies in **Passing, Dribbling**, followed by Shooting.
> A great midfielder is someone who **holds the ball well, passes creatively and has the ability to finish the situation.** They dictate play and create chances for their teammates and themselves.
- **Forwards (FW):**
> Top 10% excel in **Shooting, Dribbling, Passing** ‚Äì the ultimate attacking skill set.
> Legendary forwards are those who **can decide the game with their individual skill** and scoring ability.

Now let's look at the boxplot representation of the distribution to see it more clearly.

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/GkAttrsDistribution(5%25vsOthrs).png)

- In the **goalkeeper (GK)** group, the players in the **top 5%** have a **well-rounded and consistent skill set.** They are not just excellent in a few stats, but are **equally good in all the mandatory aspects** of the GK position ‚Äì from **reflexes, positioning, kicking** to **reactions.**
- The Top 5% group has a shorter box, meaning low variability and few outliers, for example goalkeeping_reflexes and movement_reactions of the Top 5% group are both concentrated around 80‚Äì88. This implies that **Legend GKs are consistent**, maintaining a **high level of performance regardless of temporary fluctuations** in form.
- Notably, **reactions** and **reflexes** are the attributes that show the biggest gap between the Legend group and the rest ‚Äì this is related to the ability to **make spectacular saves**, which is **what makes a great goalkeeper.**

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/MainAttrsDistribution(5%25vsOthrs).png)

- **Overall:**
  - Across all metrics and roles, the **Top 5% are clearly superior** to the rest.
  - Not only do they have higher median values, but the **Top 5% are also more consistent** (shorter boxes, fewer outliers), showing that they are well-rounded and consistent players.
- **Defenders (DF):**
  - **Defending** is the most prominent strength, with the Top 5% having a median >80 compared to the rest of the group around ~65.
  - **Dribbling, Passing and Physic** also stand out, showing that today's top defenders are not only defensive but also participate in building play and competing strongly.
  - There is also a difference in **Pace** - speed is the factor that distinguishes normal defenders from top defenders.
>‚úÖ ***Great Defenders** is not only good at defending but also has good speed, stamina and ball handling technique.*
- **Midfielders (MF):**
  - **Passing and Dribbling** are the two most distinguishing factors ‚Äì Top 5% have excellent passing and dribbling abilities (~80 and above).
  - **Shooting, Defending and Physic** are also slightly better, showing that they are not only playmakers but can also defend or score directly when needed.
  - The difference in **pace** is less, a good midfielder does not need to be too fast.
> ‚úÖ ***Great Midfielders** is a versatile player, capable of controlling the game with technique and physicality, while contributing to both attack and defense.*
- **Forwards (FW):**
  - **Shooting** is the most distinguishing factor ‚Äì Top 5% have median >80, while the other group ~65.
  - **Dribbling and Passing** are also clearly superior, showing that ball handling and passing skills are core factors.
  - **Pace and Physic** are also better ‚Äì a great forward is not only a goal scorer but also has good physicality and speed.
> ‚úÖ ***Great Forwards** is a player with excellent scoring ability, good dribbling and coordination, and has the speed to break through to create breakthroughs.*

**üìå Conclusion**
> *In every position, the Top 5% players not only excel in a specific stat, but also have a **comprehensive and consistent performance**. The biggest difference between them and the rest lies in the core skills of each position ‚Äì for example: Reflexes & Reactions for Goalkeepers, Passing & Dribbling for Midfielders or Shooting & Dribbing for Forwards. It is this **consistent excellence** that is the foundation for creating a great player in football.*

## **What core attributes make great players?**
> ***Based on FIFA player attributes, what are the core features that distinguish top 5% players from the rest?***
> 
- To analyze this we will use a logistic regression model to distinguish the great players (top 5%) from the rest.
- After determining the core attributes, we will train the model and evaluate it based on the classification report and the ROC Curve graph.

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/ClassRp.jpg)
![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/ROCCurve-LR.png)

Based on classification report and ROC Curve:
- Overall performance is very good: **Accuracy 97%**, **ROC AUC 0.99** ‚Üí the model distinguishes very well between top 5% players and the rest.
- The model achieves: **Precision = 0.82** and **Recall = 0.71** for class 1 (top 5% excellent players), meaning the model correctly detects many "great" players, **limiting false positives relatively well.**
- Note the imbalance of the data set: Class 1 only accounts for **about 6%** of the data set, this explains why Recall class 1 = 0.71, lower than class 0. However, **high precision** for class 1 is a positive point.

> ‚úÖ Logistic Regression Model Easy to understand, simple, shows very good efficiency in classifying "great players". Used to **determine the core attributes that make great players** (via coefficients).

Next, we will analyze features importance via model and see which 15 features have the most impact.

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/LRCoffs-Top15Attrs.png)

"What core attributes make great players?"
The most important attributes (by coefficient):
- **Reactions (‚Üë)** - Highest coefficient:
 - **The ability to react to second-ball situations in the match** is the most important factor that helps distinguish the top 5% players.
 - "Great" players often react quickly to situations, making the difference in important moments.
- **Positioning (‚Üì)** - Highest negative coefficient. Although it seems paradoxical, the negative coefficient here **does not mean that this index is bad**, but it can be due to:
 - This index is often high in forwards, not common in midfielders or defenders
 - Or because this variable is negatively correlated with being in the top 5% because the model differentiates by position.
- **Ball control (‚Üë)** and **short passing (‚Üë)**
‚Üí Technical ball handling, control and short passing skills are important for top players.
- **Reflexes (‚Üë)** and other GK stats ‚Üí Suggests that the top 5% also **include excellent goalkeepers**, who are considered half of the team.
- **Sprint speed (‚Üë)** and **heading accuracy (‚Üë)** ‚Üí Sprint speed and heading ability ‚Äì typical skills of high-class forwards.

> üìå The best players usually possess:
- **Quick reactions**
- **Good ball control and short passing**
- **High speed**
- **Role-specific skills ‚Äì such as reflexes (GK), short passing (MF) or heading accuracy (FW)**

**Conclusion**
> ***Apart from the goalkeeper position, which is a very special position in football, we can see that the most core attributes of a great player are all in the stats that serve the ability to attack and find goals. This means that a midfielder or forward who plays well will always have an advantage over a defender in the race for individual titles, which is absolutely true in modern football.***

### **Recommendations**

**For Coaches**
- **Develop Reactions & Ball Control early:** These are the most decisive attributes across all positions ‚Äì crucial for quick decision-making and in-game adaptation.
- **Train holistic skill sets:** Top players are consistent and well-rounded. Focus on building not just role-specific abilities (e.g. finishing for forwards) but also complementary ones (e.g. short passing, sprint speed, vision).
- **Position-tailored development:** Prioritize reflexes and reactions for goalkeepers, short passing and dribbling for midfielders, and heading accuracy with sprint speed for forwards.

**For Scouts**
- **Target well-rounded performers:** Top 5% players are not just excellent in one metric, but show **consistency across multiple relevant attributes.**
- **Reactions as a scouting filter:** High reaction scores can indicate a player‚Äôs ability to adapt, anticipate and influence critical moments.
- **Use positional benchmarks:** Great players exhibit different attribute patterns per position ‚Äì compare candidates within their roles, not across all.

**For Analysts**
- **Refine model features by role:** Some attributes (like Positioning) may behave differently depending on position ‚Äì models must account for such positional bias.
- **Monitor performance consistency:** Shorter interquartile ranges in top players show lower variability. Use this to identify high-reliability profiles.
- **Evaluate underrated players by multi-attribute comparison:** Look beyond high individual stats ‚Äì focus on **combinations** that align with top-tier profiles.

**‚úÖ Key Insight:**
> *What makes a great player is not just exceptional ability in one area, but the consistent excellence across the core demands of their position. Modern football increasingly rewards versatility, decision-making speed, and technique ‚Äî all measurable through the right set of performance attributes.*

With specific player dataset like FIFA's which has many attributes and is often non-linear, we will use Random Forest Regression to predict player value because this model is less sensitive to outliers. However, we will build 2 parallel models Linear Regression and Random Forest to compare why Random Forest is chosen.

|index|Model|MAE|RMSE|R¬≤|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|0|Linear Regression|3210957|5880733|0\.5402|
|1|Random Forest|1644806|3952449|0\.7923|

After train 2 models and evaluate them we can see the comparison between **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest**:
**Random Forest excels**
- With R¬≤ = 0.79, the Random Forest model **explains nearly 80% of the variation in player prices** ‚Üí very good for real-world data with a lot of noise.
- MAE ~ 1.64 million ‚Ç¨ is a fairly **low average error** compared to the market size (most mid-range players are in the 1‚Äì10 million ‚Ç¨ range).

**Simple Linear Regression and underfitting**
- Only reaching R¬≤ = 0.54 ‚Üí the linear model **ignores many nonlinear relationships**, not suitable for complex data characteristics such as football (many interacting factors, nonlinear).
- High RMSE ‚Üí poor sensitivity to outliers.

>**Conclusion:** Random Forest outperforms Linear Regression across all three metrics and is especially suitable for predicting player values in a complex, non-linear dataset like FIFA.

Next, we will evaluate 2 models based on error distribution:

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/CompareLR%26RF.png)

**Linear Regression:**
- The error distribution is **wider** and shows a **clear right skew**, indicating many cases where the model **underpredicts player values**, especially for high-value players.
- Presence of **large positive outliers**, where predicted values are much lower than the actual ones.
- The distribution is not symmetrical ‚Üí **the model struggles with complex or non-linear data.**

**Random Forest:**
- The error distribution is **tightly concentrated around 0** and almost **symmetrical**, showing that most predictions are close to actual values.
- **Sharp and tall peak**, indicating **high accuracy and consistency.**
- Very few large outliers ‚Üí the model **handles non-linearity and extreme values well.**

**üìå Conclusion:**
- **Random Forest significantly outperforms** Linear Regression in terms of both accuracy and stability.
- With a focused, balanced error distribution and fewer outliers, **Random Forest is a more reliable choice** for predicting real-world player values.
- In contrast, **Linear Regression is highly sensitive to outliers** and unsuitable for modeling complex player valuation data.

And now we can analyze features importance based on Random Forest model:

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/Top20Factors(RF).png)

**Factor Importance Analysis (Top 20 Factors):**
The graph shows the influence of features on **real-life player value**, as assessed by the **Random Forest model**.
- **Potential** is the **dominant factor** with an importance coefficient of **over 0.6**, indicating that the **market values future development potential more than current skills** ‚Üí This explains why **promising young talents** often have **very high transfer prices**.
- **Wage** ranks **second** ‚Üí Reflects a player‚Äôs **current role in the squad**, **recognition from the club**, and is **strongly correlated** with market value.
- **Age** is the **third most important** feature ‚Üí Shows that **younger players** are **valued higher** due to their **longer playing career** and **investment potential**.
- **Mental & physical attributes** like composure, stamina, reactions, sprint_speed, acceleration, positioning and finishing appear prominently in the top 20 ‚Üí These are **critical for midfielders and forwards**, who are **often more valuable** than defenders or goalkeepers.

‚úÖ **Summary Insight:**
> **Long-term and strategic factors** ‚Äî such as **potential**, **salary**, **age**, **fitness**, and **composure** ‚Äî have **much greater influence** than pure technical skills in determining player value.

‚öΩ This reflects the modern transfer market's mindset: **Don‚Äôt just buy current ability ‚Äî invest in future growth**, as **technical attributes can develop through match experience**.

## **Can we use in-game attributes to approximate real-world player value?**

Before analyzing this we will evaluate a little more about RF model:

![Alt text](https://github.com/hoangbui93/Decoding-Modern-Football-Tactics-Talent-and-Transfer-Value/blob/main/pics/EvaluateRF.png)

- Most points are closely aligned along the **diagonal line**, suggesting that the model captures the underlying **relationships between features and market value** quite well.
- Compared to traditional models like **Linear Regression**, which often fail to model **nonlinear patterns** and produce systematic errors, **Random Forest** shows **stronger performance and generalization ability.**
- However, we observe a **consistent underestimation** for players with **extremely high values** (e.g., above ‚Ç¨100M).
‚Üí This may stem from **data imbalance** or the presence of **intangible factors** (e.g., media hype, brand value) that aren't fully captured by the model.

Now we can show the Top 10 Market Value Overestimated by the Model:

**Overestimated Players (Model > Market)**
The chart highlights players whose **model-predicted values are significantly higher than their actual market prices.** This may occur due to:
- Strong in-game attributes but players are past their prime.
- The model not fully capturing off-pitch factors such as age, recent form, injury history, or transfer context.
- Real-world valuations being influenced by media hype, club strategy, or market trends.
> This suggests that while the model recognizes technical and physical potential, **the real market applies additional filters** beyond data-driven attributes.

**Underestimated Players (Model < Market)**
Notably, Cristiano Ronaldo appears here ‚Äî the model significantly undervalues him compared to the market. Possible reasons include:
- The model lacks variables reflecting global popularity, brand value, and commercial impact.
- Market value reflects not only technical ability but also **off-the-field influence**, fan engagement, and legacy.
> This reinforces that **predictive models need to integrate both quantitative and qualitative dimensions** to align better with real-life dynamics.

‚úÖ **Conclusion**

The Random Forest model provides an **objective, attribute-based estimation** of a player's value on the market.

However, the discrepancies between predicted and real-life values reveal:
- The model excels at assessing technical and physical ability.
- It struggles with intangible elements like reputation, media perception, or commercial value.

This misalignment is not a flaw ‚Äî it‚Äôs an opportunity for deeper analysis.

### **Recommendations**
Based on the findings from the Random Forest model and the comparison between predicted and actual market values, we propose several recommendations for key stakeholders involved in player scouting, valuation, and decision-making.

**1. For Clubs and Scouting Departments:**
- Clubs should broaden their evaluation framework by prioritizing **long-term and strategic indicators** such as **player potential, physical fitness**, and **mental attributes**, rather than relying solely on current technical ability.
- Talented young players with high potential are often **undervalued in the market**, representing **high-return investment opportunities** if identified and signed early.
- The model can serve as a **data-driven scouting assistant**, helping clubs to uncover **underrated players** whose in-game attributes suggest higher future value.

**2. For Football Data Analysts:**
- Future models should consider integrating **off-pitch factors** such as **media impact, commercial value, injury history**, and **recent form**, which significantly influence real-world transfer fees.
- Discrepancies between predicted and actual values should be viewed as **anomaly indicators**, highlighting cases where players might be mispriced and warrant further qualitative analysis.
- These insights can contribute to building **interactive dashboards** that blend quantitative model outputs with expert scouting reports for more balanced and strategic decision-making.

**3. For Club Executives and Investors:**
- Transfer decisions should not be overly influenced by **brand value or name recognition**, especially when these elements are not reflected in technical or physical performance.
- Model predictions can provide a **reference point during transfer negotiations**, helping clubs avoid overpaying based on market hype or pressure.
- Investing in **young, high-potential players** not only aligns with model recommendations but also supports long-term club growth and financial sustainability.

**Final Through**
>*The model is not designed to replace human judgment in scouting but rather to act as a **decision support tool.** When combined with expert insights and qualitative assessments, such models can significantly enhance a club‚Äôs ability to operate efficiently in a **highly competitive and dynamic transfer market.***
